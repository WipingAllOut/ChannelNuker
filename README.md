# Channel Nuker

A simple interactions.py discord bot to nuke text channels. Deletes a channel and creates an exact copy of it. Can be used to delete all messages in a channel, while some of the messages are more than 2 weeks old and can't be deleted normally with a bot.


## Installation

Python 3.10+ is required

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/WipingAllOut/ChannelNuker
  cd ChannelNuker
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now open main.py and set your bot token (can be found at https://discord.com/developers/applications)

```py
BOT_TOKEN = "Your Token"
```

Start the bot

```bash
python main.py
```
